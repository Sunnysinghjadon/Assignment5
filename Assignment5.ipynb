    "3)Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers. This means that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered distinct, and using different cases will result in different identifiers. For example, myVariable and myvariable are treated as two different variables in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)The correct extension for Python files is .py. For example, script.py is a typical filename for a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Python code is interpreted. When you run a Python program, the source code is directly interpreted and executed by the Python interpreter without prior compilation into machine code. The Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line, translating it into machine instructions on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)In Python, blocks of code are defined using indentation. The main blocks of code in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Functions: Defined using the def keyword followed by a function name and a colon. The indented code beneath the function definition is the function body.\n",
    "b)Conditional Statements: Such as if, elif, and else blocks. The code within these blocks is executed conditionally based on the evaluation of certain expressions.\n",
    "c)Loops: Such as for loops and while loops. The code within these loops is executed repeatedly until certain conditions are met.\n",
    "d)Classes: Defined using the class keyword followed by a class name and a colon. The indented code beneath the class definition is the class body.\n",
    "\n",
    "7)The character used to give single-line comments in Python is the hash symbol (#). Anything written after the hash symbol on the same line is considered a comment and is not executed by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)Two functions that can help find the version of Python you are currently working on are:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)sys.version: This function returns a string representing the version number and additional information about the Python interpreter.\n",
    "b)platform.python_version(): This function returns a string representing the version number of the Python interpreter.\n",
    "c)Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called \"lambda\" functions. Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions that can be defined without a name. They are typically used when you need a simple function for a short period and don't want to define a formal function using the def keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "10)PIP stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\" or \"Pip Installs Python.\" It is the package installer for Python and is used to install, upgrade, and manage Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other package repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several built-in functions that are readily available for use. Some commonly used built-in functions in Python include print(), len(), input(), type(), range(), max(), min(), sum(), abs(), str(), int(), float(), list(), dict(), tuple(), and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum possible length of an identifier in Python is not explicitly defined. However, Python imposes a practical limit, which is typically 255 characters. It is considered good practice to keep identifiers reasonably short and descriptive for readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some benefits of using Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn and read: Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it easier for beginners to grasp and understand.\n",
    "Large standard library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of pre-built modules and functions, making development faster and easier.\n",
    "Cross-platform compatibility: Python code can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.\n",
    "Extensive third-party libraries and frameworks: Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks for\n",
